# What is this

This repository aggregates spam numbers from the FTC-DNC Registry over the past 90 days, for use in the [SpamBlocker](https://github.com/aj3423/SpamBlocker) app.

They do provide an [API](https://www.ftc.gov/developer/api/v0/endpoints/do-not-call-dnc-reported-calls-data-api) for downloading numbers, but it requires email registration.
