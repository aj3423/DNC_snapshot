# What is this

This repo collects daily spam numbers from the FTC-DNC, retaining the last 90 days of data numbers for the app [SpamBlocker](https://github.com/aj3423/SpamBlocker).

They do provide an [API](https://www.ftc.gov/developer/api/v0/endpoints/do-not-call-dnc-reported-calls-data-api) for this, but it requires email registration.
